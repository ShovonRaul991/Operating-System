Write a complete C program that reads a number  n as command line argument. That is, uses "int argc" and "char *argv[]" to read  n when the program is executed as "./a.out n".

The program then creates n child processes P1, P2, ..., Pn such that Pi, 1 ≤  i ≤  n, computes and prints the factorial of i. That is, P1 computes and prints the factorial of 1, P2 computes and prints the factorial of 2, P3 computes and prints the factorial of 3, and so on.

Please note that your program should be well-documented and properly indented for easy reading!
