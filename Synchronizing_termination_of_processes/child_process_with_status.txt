In the previous assignment you have written a C program which when executed as "./a.out executable1 executable2 ... executableN" creates N additional child processes where the 1st child process  executes the 1st executable file (given by executable1). 2nd executes the 2nd executable file (given by executable2) and so on.

In this assignment modify the program so that the parent process waits for completion of its N child processes and prints the status with which the child processes terminated along with the process id of the corresponding child process. Observe and report the status reported by a child process that terminates normally and one that terminates abnormally. Nnote that the 
first (least signficant) 8 bits of the status "reported" by a terminated child process are used by the OS (kernel) to signify abnormal termination!
