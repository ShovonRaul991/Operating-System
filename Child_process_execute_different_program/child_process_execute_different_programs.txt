Write a complete, user-friendly, well-documented and nicely-indented C program which when executed as "./a.out executable1 executable2 ... executableN" creates N child processes where the 1st child process  executes the 1st executable file (given by executable1). 2nd executes the 2nd executable file (given by executable2) and so on.  In case you have doubts regarding command line arguments in C programming, you may please consult the sample program (forkN.c) given in the lesson.

Please upload the program file(s)! If you have written your own programs for executable1 executable2 ... executableN, please upload those programs as well. You may provide any relevant information wrt your programs through the text-area field in the submission page.

Explore what happens when in place of executable files the user provides (i) a C program file (ii) a  directory (iii) a non-existent file (name), etc.,  for execution.
Write your observation and justification for this  in the text-area available in the submission page.
