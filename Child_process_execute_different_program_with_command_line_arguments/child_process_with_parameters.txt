In the previous assignment we have developed a C program which when executed as "./a.out executable1 executable2 ... executableN" creates N child processes where the 1st child process 1st executes the 1st executable file (given by executable1). 2nd executes the 2nd executable file (given by executable2) and so on.

Please note that in this assignment no scope was there to pass command line arguments to the executables. Extend the assignment so that this can be done now. That is the program now can be called as "./a.out ls -l ps -ef" such that 1st child process executes the command "ls -l" and the second one executes "ps -ef"!

Please note that "ls" or "ps" are executable files in "/bin" folder. That is the absolute path for those files are "/bin/ls" and "/bin/ps". That is, the command line for testing for your program could be "./a.out /bin/ls -l /bin/ps -ef", as well.

Also please note that, here, a.out will receive 4 command line arguments ("/bin/ls", "-l", "/bin/ps", "-ef", argc being 5). Whereas, "ls" and "ps"  will be executed with 1 command line argument, "-l" and "-ef", respectevily.

"ls" and  "ps" have been  mentioned here just as examples. Your program should work for any executable file for child processes.
